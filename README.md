# 💋 Women Registration for +18 Platform

## 🔥 About the Project. V01_0415

Development of an API for registering women (for now) interested in offering adult relationship services (+18) through an online platform.

### 📖 Storytelling

Imagine "Adalgisa", a beautiful, confident woman who always turns heads wherever she goes. Tired of working 10 hours a day for minimum wage, she decides to change her life. Instead of staying on the street corners where everyone knows her, she seeks anonymity, autonomy, and security.

She finds a platform that collects her personal data, protects her identity, and allows her to work from anywhere — just informing where she plans to "give it her all" and work "hard and passionately." That’s how the idea for this API was born.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is fictional and created solely for educational and academic purposes — and possibly commercial, "who knows." No real data is collected or processed. Content may contain adult themes. Use responsibly.
