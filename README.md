# 💋 Women Registration for +18 Platform

## 🔥 About the Project

Development of an API to register women (for now) interested in offering adult relationship services (+18) through an online platform.

### 📖 Storytelling

Meet "Adalgisa" — a beautiful and confident woman who always turns heads wherever she goes. Tired of trading 10 hours a day for minimum wage, she decides to change her life. Instead of working on the street corners where everyone knows her, she seeks anonymity, freedom, and security.

She discovers a platform that collects her data, protects her identity, and allows her to work from anywhere — just informing where she intends to "give her all" and work "hard and passionately." That's how this API idea was born.
